<!---## Introduction

With the growth of electronic data resulting from research, the desire for funders to get maximum benefit from their spending and a general shift to open scholarly practices research data management has become an increasingly important issue for researchers at all stages of their research career. The UCL research data management policy intends to help researchers effectively manage their research data. This handout outlines support, further resources and research relevant to researchers in the Faculty of Engineering Sciences. -->

## UCL Research Data Management Policy

* The main expectations around Research Data Management are outlined in the
 UCL Research Data Policy: <http://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/research-support/research-data/policies> 
 
* 'Delivering a Culture of Wisdom - The 2011 UCL Research Strategy' outlines the broader UCL vision for research which includes discussion of research data. 
<http://www.ucl.ac.uk/research/vision-strategy> 

## Funders 

Following the UCL Research Data Management Policy will make you compliant with the majority of research funders. However it is important to check your funders requirements.  

* EPSRC policy framework on research data: <https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/about/standards/researchdata>

* RCUK Common Principles on Data Policy: <http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/datapolicy/>  

* Links to the Policies of a large number of funders can be found on the UCL Research Data Management page: <http://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/research-support/research-data>

## Data Protection, Intellectual Property and Copyright
It is important to be aware of other potential issues surrounding your research data, in particular when you are working with sensitive and personal data. There are a range of How-to guides available that advice on some of these issues: <http://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/research-support/research-data/best-practices#guides>

## Research Data Management services at UCL

* There is a broad range of support available for Research Data Management at UCL: <http://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/research-support/research-data>

* The Research Data Services can provide research data storage for researchers for the duration of their project: <http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/research-it/research-data>


## Data reuse case studies 

A number of case studies highlighting the exciting possibilities of data reuse. 

* Oyster gives up pearls - a project at UCL making use of TFL data on underground journeys using Oyster cards: <http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/projects/oyster-gives-up-pearls/>

* Reanalysis of RNA-Sequencing Data Reveals Several Additional Fusion Genes with Multiple Isoforms - an example of new insights from reanalysing data: <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048745>

* Does broadband access make UK firms more successful? - a case study of data reuse by the UK Data Service: <https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/use-data/data-in-use/case-study/?id=180>


## Open Science 

* Reanalyses of Randomized Clinical Trial Data <http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1902230>

## Software

Software is becoming an increasingly important research output across many disciplines. 

* The UCL Research Software Dashboard provides researchers with a place to share research code alongside other research outputs: <https://dashboard.rc.ucl.ac.uk/>

* Software Carpentry aims to 'Teach basic lab skillsfor research computing': <https://software-carpentry.org>
