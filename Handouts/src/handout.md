## Introduction

With the growth of electronic data resulting from research, the desire for funders to get maximum benefit from their spending and a general shift to open scholarly practices research data management has become an increasingly important issue for researchers at all stages of their research careers. The UCL research data management policy[^1]intends to help researchers effectively manage their research data. 

This handout outlines some of the main reasons to follow the UCL Research Data Management policy and suggest resources to help you do this. 

# What is research data?

The UCL Research Data Management policy defines research data as:

> 'facts, observations or experiences on which an argument or theory is constructed or tested. Data may
be numerical, descriptive, aural or visual. Data may be raw, abstracted or analysed, experimental or
observational. Data include but are not limited to: laboratory notebooks; field notebooks; primary research data
(including research data in hardcopy or in computer readable form); questionnaires; audiotapes; videotapes;
models; photographs; films; test responses. Research collections may include slides; artefacts; specimens;
samples.'[^2] 

In the Faculty of Engineering Sciences at UCL research data will incorporate a broad range of different types of material. Some of this may be data commonly found in other disciplines, whilst other data will very specific to a particular research project.   

The EPSRC give the following definition of Research Data:
> 'Recorded, factual material commonly retained by and accepted in the [research] community as necessary to validate research findings; although the majority of such data is created in digital format, all research data is included irrespective of the format in which it is created.'
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)

# What is research data management? 

Research data management can be described as:

>'an active process by which digital resources remain discoverable, accessible and intelligible over the longer term, a process that invests data and datasets with potential to accrue value as assets enjoying far wider us than their creators may have anticipated. In the world of research, such a value-adding process is a significant contributor to the much desired achievement of impact'. [^3]

# The UCL Research Data Management policy 

The UCL Research Data Management policy aims to

> 'provide a framework to define the responsibilities of all UCL members and to guide researchers and students in how to manage the data, enabling research data to be maintained and preserved as a first class research object and made available to widest possible audience for the highest possible impact’

The UCL policy does this by outlining a range of expectations for researchers in particular forming a Research Data Management Plan (discussed below). 

# Why make the effort? 

The above requirements may appear to place a burden on researchers so it is important to outline some of the benefits the policy intends to achieve. 


## You have to manage research data in the process of carrying out research

In the process of most research research you will produce data. This data could be minimal and in straight forward formats, or it could be large and in complex formats. Regardless this data needs to managed. 

An important reason to consider your research data management needs is to avoid data loss and corruption. Major episodes of data loss can be disruptive to a research project and in worst case scenarios can end a research project. 

However it is important to consider research data management beyond backing up data during the research process. It is also important you consider other issues such as how you will collect data, what formats data will be stored in, how to document your methods and how to potentially share your data most effectively. 

## Funder requirements 

Increasingly funders are introducing requirements around research data management. Following the UCL Research Data Management policy will help you with the following.


**Complying** with funder requirements. If you are funded by the EPSRC and publish a paper there is already an expectation that the related data will be made available where appropriate. Other funders have a variety of expectations but following the UCL policy will help you comply with the majority of these policies. 


**Apply** for research funding: because many research data funders are placing an increased importance on research data management and sharing, considering these issues before you apply will help you in developing funding proposals and demonstrate to researchers that your research will have the maximum possible impact. 


**Share** your research: many research funders are asking researchers to share the research data which supports their publications. I will return to the concerns about sharing in a moment but if you are required to share your research data the UCL policy will help ensure this is done effectively.

## Open Science 

Research data management, and in particular, the sharing of research data is part of a broader shift to 'openness' in scholarly research and publishing practices. Sharing research data has a number of benefits to researchers. 

**Citations** have been shown to be higher when the underlying study is exposed. TODO 

**Reproducible** exposing your research data allows other to interrogate your data, verify your methods and confirm or disprove your findings.

**Data reuse**: opening and sharing your data may lead to it being used in different ways, expanded upon and combined with other data. This again earns you recognition but also advances research in your discipline. One common use of open data is to assist in teaching by allowing studnets to work with real datasets.
