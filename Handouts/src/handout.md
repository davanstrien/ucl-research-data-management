## Introduction

With the growth of electronic data resulting from research, the desire for funders to get maximum benefit from their spending and a general shift to open scholarly practices research data management has become an increasingly important issue for researchers at all stages of their research career. The UCL research data management policy intends to help researchers effectively manage their research data. This handout outlines support, further resources and research relevant to researchers in the Faculty of Engineering Sciences. 

# Policies 

## UCL 

* The main expectations around Research Data Management are outlined in the
 [UCL Research Data Policy](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/research-support/research-data/policies). 
 
* [Delivering a Culture of Wisdom - The 2011 UCL Research Strategy](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/research/vision-strategy) outlines the broader UCL vision for research which includes discussion of research data. 

## Funders 

Following the UCL Research Data Management Policy will make you compliant with the majority of research funders. However it is important to check your funders requirements.  

* [EPSRC policy framework on research data](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/about/standards/researchdata/)

* [RCUK Common Principles on Data Policy](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/datapolicy/)  

* [Links](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/research-support/research-data) to the Policies of a large number of funders can be found on the UCL Research Data Management page. 

# Research Data Management services at UCL

* [There is a broad range of support available for Research Data Management at UCL.](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/research-support/research-data)

* [The Research Data Services](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/research-it/research-data) can provide research data storage solutions. 

**Reproducible** exposing your research data allows other to interrogate your data, verify your methods and confirm or disprove your findings.

**Data reuse**: opening and sharing your data may lead to it being used in different ways, expanded upon and combined with other data. This again earns you recognition but also advances research in your discipline. One common use of open data is to assist in teaching by allowing studnets to work with real datasets.
