## Data reuse case studies 

A number of case studies highlighting the exciting possibilities of data reuse. 

* Oyster gives up pearls - a project at UCL making use of TFL data on underground journeys using Oyster cards: <http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/projects/oyster-gives-up-pearls/>

* Reanalysis of RNA-Sequencing Data Reveals Several Additional Fusion Genes with Multiple Isoforms - an example of new insights from reanalysing data: <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048745>

* Does broadband access make UK firms more successful? - a case study of data reuse by the UK Data Service: <https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/use-data/data-in-use/case-study/?id=180>

## Software

Software is becoming an increasingly important research output across many disciplines.

* The UCL Research Software Dashboard provides researchers with a place to share research code alongside other research outputs: <https://dashboard.rc.ucl.ac.uk/>

* Software Carpentry aims to 'Teach basic lab skills for research computing': <https://software-carpentry.org>

* How does software fit into EPSRC’s research data policy?,  Neil Chue Hong, Software Sustainability Institute: <https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/epsrc-research-data-policy-and-software>

* Choosing an open-source licence, Neil Chue Hong and Tim Parkinson, Software Sustainability Institute: <https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/adopting-open-source-licence>

* Jupyter notebooks allow researchers to share code and data analysis in a transparent and reproducible format. Jupyter notebooks are also an excellent way of teaching students coding: <http://jupyter.org/>
